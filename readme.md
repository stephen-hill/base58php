## Long Term Support

Each major version of this library will be supported for 5 years after it's initial release. Support will be provided for security and bug fixes.

Version 1 will therefore be supported until the 11th September 2019.

## Background

I wanted a replacement for Base64 encoded strings and the [Base58 encoding used by Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding) looked ideal. I looked around for an existing PHP library which would directly convert a string into Base58 but I couldn't find one, or at least one that worked correctly and was also well tested.

So I decided to create a library with the following goals:

- Encode/Decode PHP Strings
- Simple and easy to use
- Fully Tested
- Available via Composer

## Requirements

This library has the following requirements:

- PHP => 7.2
- BC Math Extension

## Installation

I recommend you install this library via Composer.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "stephenhill/base58": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

## Basic Usage

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

$base58 = new StephenHill\Base58();

$base58->encode('Hello World');
$base58->decode('JxF12TrwUP45BMd');
```

## Advanced Usage

By default this library chooses the encoding service provider to use, either GMPService or BCMathService (in that order).
If you want to specify one of the included services or your own, you can inject it into the constructor.

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

$gmp = new StephenHill\GMPService();
$base58 = new StephenHill\Base58(null, $gmp);

$base58->encode('Hello World');
$base58->decode('JxF12TrwUP45BMd');
```

Also by default, this library uses Bitcoin's Base58 alphabet. If you want to use another variant, you can do this in the constructor.

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

// Flickr's Base58 Alphabet
$base58 = new StephenHill\Base58('123456789abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ');

$base58->encode('Hello World');
$base58->decode('iXf12sRWto45bmC');
```

## Testing

This library is tested using PHPUnit.

```bash
$ bin/phpunit
```

## Benchmarking

You can benchmark this library using [Athletic](https://github.com/polyfractal/athletic).
The benchmarking suite also benchmarks PHP's built-in Base64 and Base16 encoding for comparison.

```bash
$ bin/athletic -p benchmarks
```

Example output.
